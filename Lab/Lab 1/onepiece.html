                        <p>Zoro usually maintains a very stern, serious, and distanced personality, but often loses his temper in a goofy and exaggerated comical style. It would seem however, that this anger is the only emotion that Zoro often feels comfortable showing. Outside of situations where he feels confident in battle, he tends to smile or laugh the least out of the Straw Hats and rarely fools around with the rest of the crew and likes to distance himself more to sleep or train.</p>

                            <p>One of Sanji's most easily noticeable characteristics is the kind, calm, cool, and collected manner in which he carries himself. He tends to speak in a very composed manner, even in dire situations, and rarely acts without thinking. His demeanor in a lot of ways can be compared to that of a secret agent. This is amplified by the fact that he tends to wear a suit, very often enjoys a smoke, and in the anime, they tend to play smooth music with jazzy undertones when he speaks. He quite often makes comedic exceptions to this, such as when in the presence of beautiful women, or when angered by a crew member.</p>

                    <p>In the series, Nami is the Straw Hat Pirates' navigator, who dreams of drawing a map of the entire world. Despite her initial distrust of pirates, Nami eventually changes her mind after being around Luffy and the rest of the crew. Nami is depicted as an intelligent girl who is obsessed with obtaining money. She is able to use her three-sectioned staff and her climate skills to create powerful attacks; the most prominent of these staff weapons is the Clima-Tact, in which she manipulates the climate to create weather-based attacks.</p>

                                Usopp has been cowardly, known to constantly lie and enjoys telling tall tales to both friends and strangers alike. He is generally seen as the comic relief of the Straw Hats as well as the weakest member of the crew. Despite his cowardly disposition, he is unselfish, compassionate, and strives to become a great pirate as well as better himself. He also works hard to keep the crew safe and help his fellow crew members accomplish their own dreams as well as his own.

                        <p>He is the fifth member to join and the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. Chopper is frequently featured on official merchandise, serving as a mascot for the series.

                            The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruitprovides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid. A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball enables him to perform even more transformations for a short time.</p>

                        <h3>Nico Robin</h3>
                    <article>
                     <p>
                        When the crew is sailing, Nico Robin is usually reading and investigating data from the places they visit. She is very wise and very patient in everything. Robin does not play a specific role in the ship, but she can foresee what can be found somewhere and that (in her own words), is of advantage to others. Luffy considers her a very intelligent member.

                        Through her heritage on the island of scholars, Robin is an archaeologist and historian who seeks the comfort and freedom to study the mysteries of the world. She is the quieter, more reserved crew member, rarely having outbursts of emotions (occasional exceptions being sweat drops, and when she cried out to Luffy and the Straw Hats from the Tower of Justice during the Enies Lobby Arc). She even appears calm while speaking ominously around her crewmates. She has an "adult charm" about her, as stated by Sanji. Being described as the "mother" by Oda she in kind has shown maternal care for others like Chopper, Momonosuke, and Toko.

                        <p>
                            Franky is an exhibitionist and a self-proclaimed pervert. He is strong-willed, eccentric, free-spirited, and often has a blatant disregard for rules and norms. He does whatever he wants whenever he wants, though he usually wants little more than to build powerful ships or protect those he cares about and at times can appear very eccentric compared to most of the crew because of his strange mannerisms and knack for building odd things (such as his Franky Centaur). He is also highly self-aggrandizing, reveling in how "SUPER" he is and how brilliant his body or inventions are.

                        <article>
                            <p>
                                Brook is an eccentric character with a distinct personality of his own, like the other Straw Hat Pirates.

                                While he looks like and thinks himself to be a gentleman, he does possess vulgar and perverted manners such as asking to see women's panties , yelling impatiently for food , and occasionally burping and farting conspicuously. Despite this behavior, he still remains very polite, formal, and soft spoken in speech, usually referring to people using the respectful "-san" ("Sir") and always speaks to everyone even enemies in a very courteous manner. He appreciates the simplest of things: from a gesture of kindness, the company of others, and walking in the sunlight after receiving his shadow back.

                        <p>
                            Jinbe is a fish-man of great pride and honor. He is known to the World Government as a pirate-hating pirate, possibly due to the actions of the pirates in Fish-Man Island, kidnapping fish-men and merfolk to sell them as slaves. However, he has great respect for Whitebeard and his crew as he sees them as a completely different story. Because of what Whitebeard had done for his homeland, Fish-Man Island, he understands the damage a war between the World Government and Whitebeard would cause. He knows that places like his home, which are protected by simply being part of Whitebeard's territory, would suffer the most should Whitebeard lose the war.
